## General information about the projects

 For C/C++, labs were presented in the course to familiarize students with the language.  
 For C# and Kotlin, after mastering the basics of the language, students were asked to write their own learning projects

## C/C++

Each directory contains a different lab work. They start from the very bottom, creating Make-files, to meta-programming, working with threads, etc.  
Detailed information on the lab work is written in README.md in the appropriate directory

## C#

During the course it was proposed to implement your own DBMS with SQL-like syntax(CRUD) in C#.  
The project is divided into 2 main parts - parser and data devices.  
Detailed information about the interaction is written in STAGE-N.md

## Kotlin

As a project I realized an android application - a local game of tic-tac-toe over TCP.  
More detailed information on the technology stack can be found in [documentation(only RUS)](Kotlin/Project/Documentation(RUS).pdf).
